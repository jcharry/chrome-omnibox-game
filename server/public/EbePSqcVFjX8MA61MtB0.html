            <p>Hella.  They're moving me to Hella, must be.</p>
            <p>Okay, now we're getting somewhere.  We could call the cops right now, but I don't want to spook them so they change up their plans.  We know where I'm going, so let's sit tight til I'm there.  Maybe we can get an exact location and not risk any messups.</p>
            <p>I'm gonna wait it out til we get to Hella, then I'll send you an update</p>
