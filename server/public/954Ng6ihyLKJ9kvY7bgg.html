            <p>Things didn't go quite as planned.  They moved me, but they roughed me up pretty good.  As a result, my PDA got a little beat up.  They didn't find it, which is a miracle, but it's malfunctioning.  Hopefully it'll last long enough...</p>
            <p>I'm sending you one more photo.  I was blindfolded the whole time, but I managed to carefully pull out my PDA and take photos out of the car window.  Most were garbage. Blurry, or just fields.  But this one...I was lucky enough to capture a sign post.</p>
            <p>As for where I am now - I'm stuck in a house.  I'm locked in a small glass room in the middle of the house, so I can't walk around, but I can see a tiny bit of a small yellow car out the window.  I know it's not much, but It's all I can tell you at the moment.  If you can get the coordinates of the house, you need to tell someone quickly.  I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up.</p>
