            <p>A serious stroke of luck just hit me right in the face.  Up until now I haven't heard anyone else.  But a few minutes ago I heard some footsteps walking past my door.  I looked under the crack in the door, and saw what looked like a piece of paper.  Once I felt safe the man was gone, I used my belt, slid it under the door, jiggled it on top of the paper, and dragged the paper close enough to bring into my room.</p>
            <p>As far as I can tell it's jibberish. I don't know Icelandic, but even I know that this can't be icelandic.  Maybe it's encrypted?  I doubt they're using anything sophisticated.  Could you attempt to decrypt it?</p>
