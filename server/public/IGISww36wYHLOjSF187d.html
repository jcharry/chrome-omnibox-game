            <p>Fantastic, I knew I could count on you!</p>
            <p>Okay, first thing's first, I'm in a small room.  There's a tiny window.  I haven't seen any defining landmarks, but I have seen a bird hanging around.</p>
            <p>I'm sending you a photo I took just a few hours ago.  If we can identify this bird, we might be able to figure out where I'm being kept.</p>
            <p>Once you've figured it out, can you let me know the name of the bird?  I feel like I know it, but it's just on the tip of my tongue.</p>
